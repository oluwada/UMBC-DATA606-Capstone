## Research Experience 
*Graduate Research Assistant(Volunteer)*, __UMBC-Baltimore,MD__  , November 2024 - May 2025
- Filtered clinical breast cancer CNA and mRNA dataframes and used gene-based features to 
classify tumor hypoxia levels
- Applied machine learning models(Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification, Gradient 
Boosting, Random Forest) to predict hypoxia class
- Analyzed feature(gene) importance to identify features potentially associated with high hypoxia 
levels in tumors  
- Reviewed scientific papers using Covidence and completed curated forms to classify study type, 
demographics, research focus 
- Contributed to research poster presented at UMBC’s annual Undergraduate Research and 
Creative Achievement Day(URCAD)

*Summer Research Intern*, **Penn State, State College, PA**, June - July 2022 
- Explored the structure and post translational modification of the intrinsically disordered carboxy -terminal 
domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II(RNA Pol II) 
- Conducted phosphorylation experiments and assisted with mass spectroscopy to identify modified amino 
acids and phosphorylation patterns. 
- Presented research findings at Pennsylvania State Research Symposium
  
## PROJECTS 
*US Hurricane Analysis and Forecasting Using Big Data Analytics* - **Platforms for Big Data Processing**, SPRING 2025 
- Configured Hadoop to store raw data and used PySpark to create a structured dataframe
- Conducted exploratory analysis on hurricane data to uncover trends
- Engineered time/location based features in Jupyter Notebook
- Ran machine learning algorithms to predict hurricane landfall locations
  
*Splice Junction Classification from Sequences* - **Introduction to Data Analysis and Machine Learning**, SPRING 2025 
- Cleaned and pre-processed DNA sequence data by removing additional whitespace from each string sequence
- Manually implemented one hot encoding to represent each nucleotide numerically for the machine learning algorithms to interpret
