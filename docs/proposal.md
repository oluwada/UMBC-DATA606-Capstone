## Background

- What is this about?
	- Using machine learning to uncover the biological patterns of the Cardiac system commonly asscoiated with being vitamin D deficient.
   
 - Why does this matter?
  	- Vitamin D Deficieny is a **global health problem**
  	- Vitamin D plays an essential role in regulating the heart. Low vitamin D levels can cause blood pressure to be high causing the heart to overwork to pump blood and damage the heart over time.
     
- Research Questions:
  - What are the biological patterns associated with being vitamin deficient in the cardiac system.
  - What are the biological patterns associated with being vitamin deficient and blocking cation channels(TRPC6) in the cardiac system.
  - How does the intensity of a hard-working heart correlate with vitamin D.
